# AI-Driven Hydroponic System Optimization 🌱🤖

## Overview

Welcome to our AI-driven hydroponic system optimization project, powered by Intel's oneAPI toolkit, Data Parallel C++ (DPC++), and Intel's Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN). This project represents a pioneering approach to revolutionize hydroponic crop growth using the cutting-edge capabilities of artificial intelligence.

Our primary objective is to empower hydroponic systems to operate autonomously, making informed decisions in real-time without relying on extensive labeled training data. To achieve this, we leverage the versatile features of oneAPI, DPC++, and oneDNN, allowing our system to learn, adapt, and optimize dynamically.

## Key Components

### Installation and Hardware Optimization 💻🔧

We harness the power of the oneAPI toolkit to maximize the potential of available hardware resources, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

### Data-Driven Deep Learning 🧠📊

We implement DPC++ and oneDNN to create a neural network architecture tailored for unsupervised learning. This architecture enables the system to autonomously discover concealed patterns and adapt to evolving conditions.

### Real-time Adaptation 🔄⚙️

Our system integrates insights from the deep learning model to make real-time adjustments to environmental parameters within the hydroponic system.

### Efficiency and Performance 🚀📈

With oneAPI's support for various hardware accelerators, we meticulously optimize our code to ensure efficiency and peak performance on different targets.

### User Interface 🖥️📱

We are developing an intuitive user interface for real-time system monitoring and manual intervention, making it easy for users to interact with and oversee the system.

## Our Vision 👁️

Our project aspires to be a game-changer in the realm of hydroponic agriculture. We introduce a sustainable and intelligent approach that not only enhances crop growth but also optimizes resource management, leading to higher efficiency. By embracing the robust capabilities of oneAPI, DPC++, and oneDNN, we find ourselves at the forefront of the next agricultural revolution.
